# Overview
The sales_forecasting project aims to predict the future sales of a company that is venturing into data science. It focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques for sales forecasting. The project is divided into three main folders: DATA, CODES, and OUTPUT.

## DATA
This folder contains a CSV file with the historical records of the company's total sales. For privacy reasons, sensitive information such as branch, salesperson, and customer details have been removed.

## CODES
`models_evaluation.ipynb`
The "models_evaluation.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook compares and evaluates four different prediction models based on time series analysis. The notebook analyzes the data in more detail, looking for seasonality, trends, moving averages, etc. All resulting plots and visualizations are saved in the OUTPUT folder.
